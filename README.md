# Konsodi
Interactive Python console/shell for Kodi.  
## Introduction
Sometimes when I was developing Kodi addons I needed to quickly test some small code snippets, before using it.  
Usually I had to use xbmc.log() function or write some small dummy addons for debugging.  
But that all was very inconvenient, especially considering that one of the remarkable Python features is built-in interactive interpreter (or shell, or console).  
I really missed it in Kodi. So, I decided to write one!..  
Now, please welcome Konsodi - interactive Python console/shell. Hope it will be useful for someone.

## Usage
Interface of Konsodi is very familiar and simple. Just text field for command input, "Run" button, and the textbox with the results.  
You can:  
- Enter command in the appropriate field;  
- Run it - using special onscreen button or pressing Enter twice (I know it would be more usual to press Enter only one time, but I didn't want to break standard Kodi features, though I could);  
- See the results (good or not :-)) in the history textbox;  
- Scroll the results using mouse wheel or fancy buttons;  
- Move through command history using Up and Down keys.
  
And that's it.  
So, have fun!  Wish you a pleasant debugging and new awesome addons!  
Bugreports/remarks/suggestions are welcome.
